For assignment 5, we created the parsing of our minimally useful shell.

when we read a single mush command-line, we parse it to a list of commands 
showing the inputs, outputs, and arguments of each. 

when running ./parseline, make sure you have spaces before and after each symbol
('<', '>', '|'). All of the words and all of the symbols must be separated with
a space for this to work.

Other than that, ./parseline should work as intended from the lab manual
