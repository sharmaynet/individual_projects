Our program works like a simple shell. It has fairly powerful functionality. 

A few things you need to consider: 

1. You need to have a space around '<', '>', and '|'. 
2. The built-in cd command should be the first command on the line.
3. If there are an opening a file error in the first stage and any parseline errors in next stage,
   our program prints the parse line error instead of the opening a file error.
4. There is no minimum size limits.
