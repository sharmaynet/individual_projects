detab.c operates as intended in the assignment description.

My program takes in stdin, and recurses in an integer c until it reaches
the end of the file (end of the input argument). I have an interger index
that keeps track of where the index of the stdout is. If the user passes in
a '/t', then the program checks what index the stdout is, and adds a ' ' until
the index is a multple of 8 (mimicing a tab space that indents the cursor at 
a multiple of 8). If the user inputs a '\b', the index goes back by one. If the
user inputs a '\r' or a '\n', then the index goes back to 0 becaucse in a 
carriege character, it completely erases everything before the '\r' char,
and resets the index back to 0, while in the new line, the index starts back 
to 0. If the user inputs a regular character, then the index increases by one,
and it outputs the character through putchar(c).
